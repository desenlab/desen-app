# Testing Strategy

## Test layers

1. **Protocol vectors:** Frozen official valid/invalid fixtures and exact diagnostic expectations.
2. **Unit tests:** Pure validators, resolvers, predicates, state transitions, actions, and commands.
3. **Property tests:** Determinism, canonicalization, stable identity, limits, and state-machine
   invariants.
4. **Integration tests:** Publisher pipelines, capability registration, exact package resolution,
   activation, and persistence.
5. **Component tests:** React adapters and authoring overlays without implementation leakage.
6. **Browser proof:** Desen App authors and publishes while a separately built host activates.
7. **Source audits:** No manual managed-screen tree, no forbidden imports, no executable document
   content, and no secrets.
8. **Architecture mutation fixtures:** Representative forbidden imports must be rejected by the
   named dependency rule while documented imports continue to pass.

## Evidence hierarchy

The strongest evidence is a deterministic test plus a content-addressed artifact. Manual demos are
used to explain user value and verify ergonomics, not to replace semantic tests.

## Coverage policy

No global percentage is imposed during empty scaffolding. Before public alpha:

- every in-scope protocol branch has a positive or negative vector;
- every stable diagnostic has a test;
- every activation failure path proves last-known-good preservation; and
- every public proof claim maps to at least one automated test.

Activation persistence tests inject failure before every activation stage and at the durable
transaction boundary. They cover transaction abort, storage quota failure, crash immediately
before commit, crash immediately after commit but before in-memory notification, competing stale
writers, and restart recovery. The asserted state is always a complete activation record; tests
must never accept an active pointer whose previous-good pointer was written separately.
