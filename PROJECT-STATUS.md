# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-07-21

## Plain-language status

Local implementation preparation is complete and the private GitHub repository is active at
`desenlab/desen-app`. M02-T01 proved that the implementation consumes an exact, checksum-enforced
DESEN 0.1.0 input snapshot. M02-T02 then assigned all 269 reviewed prose entries and all 989
machine-enumerated JSON Schema constraints to future implementation and test owners. Validator and
runtime semantics have not started and are not claimed as proven.

## Current milestone

- Completed gates: `G00`, `G01` (`G01` is explicitly local-only)
- Completed preparation tasks: `M01-T07 — Local tracked baseline`, `M01-T08 — Remote and CI`
- Current milestone: `M02 — Protocol package and validator`
- Completed implementation tasks: `M02-T01 — Frozen snapshot and checksum enforcement`,
  `M02-T02 — Complete protocol traceability`
- Active task: None
- Ready next task: `M02-T03 — Schema-derived or mechanically checked types`
- Status: `READY_TO_START`

## Completed preparation

- Product naming and domain responsibilities are defined.
- Web-first and future-native architecture boundaries are defined.
- The current npm `desen` package state is recorded without destructive changes.
- The workspace quality toolchain, exact lockfile, and package boundaries work locally.
- The local baseline commit is authored and committed only as Selman Ay, and a temporary clean clone
  passes the locked install and full quality gate.
- The private `desenlab/desen-app` remote is configured and its first `main` CI run passed.
- The implementation milestones, exact `web-react` conformance targets, clause owners, and proof
  claims are defined.
- The frozen protocol baseline was rerun with 14/14 suite cases passing: 9 vectors + 5 examples.
- The complete protocol trace reviews 196 normative headings, assigns 269 prose entries, and maps
  all 989 schema constraints exactly once across 61 families; 11 verifier mutation tests pass.
- The foundation passes formatting, lint, strict typecheck, build, protocol integrity tests,
  protocol traceability tests, remaining scaffold test runners, and dependency-boundary checks.

## Current blocker

No technical blocker. The following release-hygiene item remains and does not block implementation:

- The upstream repository still lacks a `v0.1.0` Git tag, but the exact commit and checksum are
  sufficient for deterministic local work. Tag creation remains release hygiene under `PF-004`.

## Next task

Complete only `M02-T03`: generate TypeScript types from the frozen JSON Schemas or prove through a
mechanical check that maintained types remain structurally aligned. Do not begin canonicalization,
diagnostic, or validator semantics in the same task.

M02-T02 evidence:

- `docs/proof/artifacts/protocol-0.1.0-traceability.json`
- artifact SHA-256: `749cbae719a5deb216e9ed3be171eb710b47fc547f4f270dbba21bb14c2af514`

## Status vocabulary

- `NOT_STARTED`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `BLOCKED`
- `DONE`

Only one implementation task may be `IN_PROGRESS` at a time.
