# Proof infrastructure

This directory contains the I07 proof-execution authority. I07-02 completed the hosted cutover:
the official `Quality gate` now executes the required exhaustive runner defined here, while the
CI-01 sequential runner remains available only through explicit manual rollback.

## Trust layers

1. Frozen task artifacts preserve the exact task-time claim and nonclaim boundary.
2. `proof-reader-checkpoints.json` records reviewed live reader hardening without rewriting those
   artifacts.
3. `exhaustive-workload-inventory.mjs` is the neutral, code-owned authority for the exact 130-node,
   61-proof-unit workload graph. It owns exact commands, arguments, dependencies, execution
   classes, and inert shared-state metadata without importing either scheduler.
4. The retained legacy sequential runner is a manual rollback mirror, not the source of the new
   graph.
   `required-exhaustive-equivalence.mjs` compares every id, label, command, and argument vector in
   order, proves set equality and exactly-once ownership, and normalizes fail-closed terminal
   receipts.
5. `infrastructure-debt.json` gives every temporary migration structure a machine-checked removal
   owner, deadline, and scoped zero-reference rule.

The checkpoint is inert data. It cannot name an executable command or cause a verifier or test to
run. Executable ownership remains in reviewed source. The neutral inventory is also inert until a
validated scheduler executes its exact shell-free command vectors.

## Historical I07-01 checkpoint

I07-01 is the historical `SHADOW + EXHAUSTIVE` checkpoint. Every one of the retained plan's global
steps and proof verifier/root-test pairs ran from fresh inputs. Candidate proof pairs could run
with concurrency two while the sequential result remained authoritative; no changed-file filter,
cached proof success, generator, or evidence writer was admitted. Its removed comparison wrapper
is authenticated by the I07-01 and I07-02 baselines; it is no longer a current command surface.

## I07-02 required-exhaustive architecture

```bash
node --test scripts/ci/test/exhaustive-workload-inventory.test.mjs
node --test scripts/ci/test/exhaustive-gate-boundary.test.mjs
node --test scripts/ci/test/shared-state-authority.test.mjs
node --test scripts/ci/test/required-exhaustive-equivalence.test.mjs
node --test scripts/ci/test/required-exhaustive-quality-gate.test.mjs
node scripts/ci/run-required-exhaustive-quality-gate.mjs
```

The I07-02 authorities establish a single `EXHAUSTIVE` target whose plan factory defaults to
`REQUIRED`; `SHADOW` must be explicit and any other scope fails closed. The official hosted
workflow invokes this exact command without an authority override, so the fail-closed default is
the repository pass/fail authority. The retained sequential workflow is available only through
manual `legacy-rollback`. The temporary shadow workflow and comparison adapter/test were removed
after the accepted same-revision comparison and successful hosted cutover.

Every workload has exactly one code-owned shared-state class:

| Execution class                  | Count | Authority                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ----: | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `GLOBAL_EXCLUSIVE`               |     6 | Repository-wide integrity and boundary barriers      |
| `WORKSPACE_OUTPUT_EXCLUSIVE`     |     1 | Workspace build/typecheck output writer              |
| `PACKAGE_TEST_EXCLUSIVE`         |     1 | Complete workspace package-test barrier              |
| `PROOF_READ_ONLY`                |    66 | Proof work with no shared workspace writes           |
| `PROOF_OS_TEMP_ISOLATED`         |    45 | Proof work restricted to a runner-owned OS temp root |
| `PROOF_TRACKED_ALIAS_EXCLUSIVE`  |    10 | Real tracked aliases with a drained scheduler        |
| `PROOF_WORKSPACE_TEMP_EXCLUSIVE` |     1 | The direct source-audit workspace-temp barrier       |

Fifty proof pairs are eligible for pair-level overlap at concurrency two after all dependencies
pass. Ten real tracked-alias pairs and `reference-host-web-source-audit` are the eleven exclusive
proof-pair barriers. Within every pair, the root test still depends on its verifier.

The only verifier runtime-probe exceptions, each with isolated temp and child-process authority,
are:

- `publisher-catalog-pinning`;
- `publisher-bundle-publication`;
- `publisher-official-golden`;
- `publisher-invalid-source-matrix`; and
- `control-plane-bundle-store`.

Only the `reference-host-web-source-audit` verifier/root-test pair receives the reviewed native
addon exception. Its verifier remains workspace-read-only; its root test is the sole
workspace-temp barrier.

Node 24 requires an orthogonal schema-v2 compatibility policy for eighteen exact root tests. The
distribution across all 130 workloads is 112 `NONE`, two `FIXTURE_COPY`, fifteen
`REVIEWED_SYMLINK`, and one `FIXTURE_COPY_AND_REVIEWED_SYMLINK`. Fixture copy accepts only an exact
code-owned source and bounded no-follow destination tree inside the workload temp root. Reviewed
symlinks keep temp targets local and pin fourteen workspace-target workloads to eighteen exact
target-and-kind rules: eight unsafe-input files are mirrored into temp, while ten historical
canonical-path or inode checks retain their exact tracked aliases.

The generated permissions add no shared-parent, sibling-temp, or workspace-write path. The preload
is a trusted-repository-code compatibility adapter, not an adversarial OS sandbox; every root test
already requires child-process authority. Static target/kind regressions, permission-bound temp
identity, exclusive scheduling for real aliases, and the closing tracked workspace seal provide
the enforcement appropriate to this CI boundary.

Native-addon authority is limited to the `reference-host-web-source-audit` verifier/root-test pair
and the `publisher-invalid-source-matrix` root test. The latter grants its nested programmatic
probe access to the reviewed platform-specific Rolldown binding; its verifier remains denied.

Each proof process receives a fresh authenticated temp root and generated Node permission policy.
Direct workspace-write grants, child processes, and native addons are denied unless the exact
workload classification grants them; inherited `NODE_OPTIONS` is rejected. A required preload
denies TCP and UDP listener binding. Cleanup authenticates the temp directory identity before
removing it.

Required authority cannot be fabricated through the injected callbacks used by the focused test
harness. Only the default shell-free process runner can emit an accepted required close receipt;
injected Git readers, workspace captures, guards, process functions, environments, signals, and
timeouts are rejected. The opening boundary binds clean porcelain-v2 state to the authenticated
revision before any workload starts. Hosted `SHADOW` measurement uses this same real boundary;
only focused non-authoritative tests may inject it.

The host signal handlers, scheduler, and active process registry share one first-terminal record.
The first timeout, child error, nonzero close, execution error, SIGINT, or SIGTERM fixes the reason
and exit code, immediately terminates all active groups, and prevents new launches. Later signals
may escalate to SIGKILL but cannot replace the winner. Settlement still waits for every child
`close` and isolation cleanup.

A code-owned 15-minute soft complete-gate timeout sits above the workload timeouts. Authentic
settlement still awaits child `close`, cleanup, and boundary capture. Phase A therefore wraps the
command in an 18-minute operating-system ceiling with a 30-second kill grace, inside a 25-minute
hosted job. An outer-ceiling failure is never accepted as promotion evidence.

The execution boundary authenticates the repository revision and inventory and compares tracked
bytes, executable modes, tracked-file count, and Git index object ids before and after all 130
steps, including failure paths. The shared-state boundary also seals every reviewed build/Turbo
output root across the proof phase and compares non-ignored untracked state across the complete
execution region. A dependency download cache may save network time; no build, test, checkpoint,
mutation, or proof pass is reusable authority.

## Completed promotion boundary

I07-02 recorded exact workload equality, exactly-once coverage, matching outcomes, clean
tracked-workspace parity, safe cancellation, shared-state classification, and local plus hosted
evidence before completing the workflow cutover. The accepted evidence is
`docs/proof/baselines/i07-02-required-exhaustive-equivalence.json`. I07-02 implements no
affected-path selector. Its promotion closed `DEBT-I07-008` by removing the temporary shadow
workflow and modular comparison adapter/test. I07-03 may calculate `AFFECTED` plans only in shadow;
any unknown or ambiguous input expands to `EXHAUSTIVE`. I07-04 owns selector promotion and G07-due
reader cleanup. `DEBT-I07-007` keeps the sequential runner, equivalence adapter, and other
rollback-only paths until I07-05 proves their removal gates.
